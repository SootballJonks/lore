    'T.O.G',
    'After a year of slavery in the Salt Mines of Endovier, Celaena Sardothien was accustomed to being escorted everywhere in shackles and at sword-point. Most of the thousands of slaves in Endovier received similar treatment—though an extra half-dozen guards always walked Celaena to and from the mines. That was expected by Adarlan’s most notorious assassin. What she did not usually expect, however, was a hooded man in black at her side—as there was now.

    He gripped her arm as he led her through the shining building in which most of Endovier’s officials and overseers were housed. They strode down corridors, up flights of stairs, and around and around until she hadn’t the slightest chance of finding her way out again.',

Lorian had bared his brother’s curse to help ease their suffering, and in turn, he had gone from being a skilled and revered knight to being one unable to walk or speak. And, while he was reconciled to his fate & acquired disabilities, there were certainly times where he yearned to spar on the training grounds again, or laugh with comrades in the barracks.

    Just how many hours, days, months—perhaps even years—have now passed with him watching the dust swirl in the fleeting sunlight, as he rests beside Lothric? And just how many more until the fire finally fades? Is time even progressing as they lay in meditative silence? Lorian strived to push such thoughts out of his mind, for the sake of his own sanity.',
