After a few moments, they were able to free it from its sheath and take up a combat-like stance. "I guess I''ll have to convince you the hard way... Uh, t-then..." Their voice, along with their confidence, trailed off as they noticed a massive figure emerging from the darkness of the bed frame.

  Lorian''s armour scraped against the feathers and stone that littered the floor, each movement echoing around the large room as he dragged himself towards the intruder. Lothric clasped his hands together and continued, "You''ve done quite enough, unkindled one. Now have your rest."');

Nor had she missed when they zigzagged between levels, even though the building was a standard grid of hallways and stairwells. As if she’d lose her bearings that easily.

Though the man grasping her arm was tall and fit, she could see nothing of the features concealed beneath his hood. Another tactic meant to confuse and intimidate her. The black clothes were probably a part of it, too. His head shifted in her direction, and Celaena flashed him a grin. He looked forward again, his iron grip tightening.');

  (2, 2, 'Lorian felt lightweight as his brother''s miracle swirled around him, and he lifted his greatsword in anticipation to be teleported. A moment later, Lorian reappeared beside the Ashen One and brought down his sword. The Ashen One had the reflex to dive away from their impending death, just barely, as Lorian''s greatsword grazed their helmet - ripping it off of them and crushing it between the blade and the now crumbling stone floor. The Ashen One let out a shriek and lifted their sword defensively, cringing as Lorian swung his blade once more with enough force to send theirs flying.');

  The statue shifts its grip on that giant hammer across its broad shoulder, humming low in its throat as it watches you trying not to die from a second heart attack.

  (5, 6, 'The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.

  My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)

  “What?” I asked.

  “Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade.” he told me.
  </br></br>
  “Oh. My. Fucking. God!” I screamed. I love GC. They are my favorite band, besides MCR. “Well…. do you want to go with me?” he asked.
